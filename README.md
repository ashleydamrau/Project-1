## This project consists of my first website. I decided to build a website for loan processing. My coworker needed a website built and I decided to take her long webpage and divide it into different webpages under different tabs.
## The functionality of this webpage consists of:
1. Multiple tabs where you can see the main webpage, Contact Us section, our services section, and an about us page.
2. The main webpage gives information about different lenders they use and a basic rundown of the website.
3. The contact us webpage makes a form available to get in contact or redirect you to the private funding division.
4. Our services webpage talks about all the services that are provided if you do decide to go with her business.
5. Lastly, about us page gives a more in-depth about the business.

## Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. BOOTSTRAP

## Ideas for the future:
1. I would like to be able to add functionality to the website eventually using Javascript.
2. I would like a more seamless transition from a webpage down to the mobile device.
3. I would like to introduce new fonts to the webpage.
4. I would like to add more design to some of the more simple webpages.
